# Safety enhancements
Role of automation & robotics in safety enhancements

Safety is a most sensitive measurment that implemented and demostrated its strategy in every irrespective sector in certain aspects like from manufacturing to food industry.

India is a one of most endurable nation in safety enhnacements to improve the good and better productivity rate.
our country trying , dedicating to improve with energic enhancement to beat the lack/poverty of safety and sensitive by forwarding in the globalization in economics.

Many schemes like :

1. MAKE IN INDIA
2. PLI (production linked incentive) scheme
3. Smart cities missions
4. several operations like educational and military.

Hazardous work environments :

1. In the factories of Uranium, neon gases & high radioactive elements
2. In the sensitive chemical laboratories
3. Expensive petroluem testing laboratories
4. Heavy hot metal mold moving and lifting
5. Heavy payload liftings

Urban growth & infrasturcture stress:

1. Supplying of electricity in Rural, tier2 & 3 cities
2. Improvementing the speed network connections
3. Ensuring the digital educations and accessiblities

Rise of AI/robotic capabilities:

1. For analysis the productive rate in aspect of economic growth
2. Less labour/manual intersection
3. Increased loss/defect identification & analysis

The different indusrty which shifted & driven impact from safety enhancements:

Manufacturing :  1. 1st term : Robotic Arm
                 2. 2nd term : COBOTS

                

1st term : Robotic arm

1. Heavy payload lifting
2. Continous production efficiency
3. 24/7 working capability

2nd term : COBOTS

1. In the sensitive chemical laboratory
2. Expensive petroleum testing laboratory
3. Costly Material handling

Infrastructure :  Drones & Robots for inspection

Drones : 

1. Faster & safer Delivery 
2. Medicine & blood supplying 
3. Surveillance & investigation in unmanned area
4. Surveying the whole buildings where humanly canno possible
5. Inspection in restricted area

Robots for inspection :

1. Inspecting the defects in industry
2. Identifying the problems in product or service using IOT & AI
3. Analysis of productivity rate
4. Risk handling and management
5. No stress and cost reductions

Agriculture : Drone for spraying and Smart tractors

1. Spraying the high concentrate pesticides
2. Spraying the acid/burnings for poison plants
3. Seeding/cutting/plantating the plants using smart tractors

Post - pendamic health consciousness :

In the period of Covid - 19, there is a drastic down fall of economic sector withholding these like industries where the indusrilaist were focused a lot to improve the productivity with better financial turnover instead of changing/paying the loss gaps.


Healthcare : Robotic surgeries, Disinfectation bots

1. High precise operation like heart & liver surgeries 
2. Fast and safe suttering for numerous patient using robotic arms
3. Opearting/ surgical arms usage during COVID-19

Defense & Disaster response : Drones, UGV's

1. Using the drones to radar enemy arenas
2. using the swarm robotics to detect the explosives
3. Implementation of robotic guns to work anytime
4. AI to analyze the attack predictions
5. Using the drone to attack the enemies
